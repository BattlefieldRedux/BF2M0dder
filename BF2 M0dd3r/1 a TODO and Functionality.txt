Add 64 bit OS support.

finish the Load Recent Mods.

ok...

filldirectories() will be the zip. if it's "" then it's /tmp/objects_server.zip.

if not, load it from there.
for example, say the zip is in the mod directory.

it will be 
FillDirectories(C:\{rootbf2mdir}\mods\Objects_server(ModName).zip);

then it will do the stuff.

worry about apply curent mod later, it would be about the modPath or something.
